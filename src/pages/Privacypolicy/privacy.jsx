        <h2>Privacy Excellence: Our Pledge to Privacy by Design</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            Farmicon is committed to the principles of Privacy by Design, an approach to privacy
            that prioritizes the inclusion of privacy protections from the outset of the development of
            our systems, products, and business practices. We adhere to the Seven Principles of
            Privacy by Design as formulated by Dr. Ann Cavoukian:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Proactive not Reactive: We strive to anticipate and prevent privacy-invasive events before they occur, rather than addressing them after the fact.</li>
            <li>Privacy as the Default: Privacy settings should be automatically set to the most private, limiting access and use of personal information to the extent necessary for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Privacy Embedded into Design: We integrate privacy measures into the design and architecture of our systems, products, and processes, ensuring that privacy is an integral part of the development lifecycle.</li>
            <li>Full Functionality: Privacy should not be sacrificed for functionality. We seek to provide full functionality without compromising privacy, adopting solutions that are positive sum, offering benefits for all stakeholders.</li>
            <li>End-to-End Security: We implement robust security measures to protect personal information throughout its entire lifecycle, from collection to storage, use, and disposal.</li>
            <li>Visibility and Transparency: We are transparent about our data practices, providing clear information to individuals about how their personal information is collected, used, and shared.</li>
            <li>Respect for User Privacy: We respect user privacy and empower individuals to have control over their personal information. We seek to offer user-friendly options and choices regarding the collection and use of their data.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            By adopting the Privacy by Design principles, Farmicon aims to enhance user privacy,
            build trust, and demonstrate our commitment to responsible data handling practices.
